# Exercise: Resume design

1. Review your current resume and talk about how you might improve it (contents & presentation). Discuss as small groups and share feedbacks.
1. Also, talk about how you would translate it into HTML page (web resume). Does your design need to change to be effective on the web?
1. Recreate your resume in HTML file with proper HTML structure. First, focus on HTML content structure. The visual style will follow after that.
1. Text only, no images. Icons are ok.
