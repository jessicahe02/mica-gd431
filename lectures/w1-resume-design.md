# Exercise: Resume design

## Part 1: Contents

1. Review your current resume and talk about how you might improve it (contents & presentation). Discuss as small groups and share feedbacks.
1. Also, talk about how you would translate it into HTML page (web resume). What are the considerations for the web resume? What is different from printed material?
1. Recreate your resume in HTML file with proper HTML structure. First, focus on HTML content structure. The visual style will follow after that.
1. Text only, no images. Icons are ok.

## Part 2: Styling

1. Once you have a good HTML structure, apply CSS to the document.
1. Pay attention to visual hierarchy and legibility.
